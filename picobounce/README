This is a simple Arduino sketch for a cheap ESP8266 board such as the
D1 Mini to interface with a Pico in order to reboot it or put it into 
BOOTSEL mode via WiFi.  It should be fairly easy to port to ESP32.

To use your shiny new WiFi Reboot/Bootsel module with the build system,
set the environment variable PICO_BOOTCTL_HOSTNAME to the hostname or
IP address of the ESP module connected to your Pico.

The default hostname for the ESP module is 'picobounce'.
