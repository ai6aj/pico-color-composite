/**

	ISSUE:
		Our DAC sucks.
		
	RESOLUTION:
		Replace 100 ohm resistors with 100+10 ohm resistors.


	ISSUE:
		Using brightness levels over about 40% causes TV to
		lock VBLANK incorrectly.
		
	RESOLUTION:
		This seemed to be caused by the TV getting confused
		if there was too much brightness in the image while
		it tried to lock to VBLANK.  We now display a dim screen 
		for a couple seconds at power on to give the TV time to 
		correctly lock.	 Once that's done, full brightness 
		can be used.



	ISSUE:	
		Something is really weird with Bit 6 / Pin 7 (dec. 64)
		Jumping from an output value of 63 to 64 causes 
		a DECREASE in brightness?  lol wut?
		
		Some things to check:
		
		Does Bit 7 do the same thing?  What happens if we
		deliberately choose values that don't use bit 6
		but do use bit 7 (i.e. hardcode all values to NOT
		use bit 6)
		
		Should we just try moving the whole DAC to gpio2-10?

    RESOLUTION:
		6 bits was hardcoded into start_video, problem was
		easily resolved by changing this to use a #define :P
		

	TODO:
		Switch palette model from direct DAC values to
		H (as phase) / S (as color signal intensity) / L (as avg value)
		triplets.
		
		Output signal is a combination of H/S + L.  H/S signal should
		probably lead by 1/2 color clock i.e.
		
		Pixel -1:
		Subsamples a,b = black
		Subsamples c,d = black + HS signal of pixel 0
		
		Pixel 0:
		Subsamples a,b = luma[0] + HS signal of pixel 0
		Subsamples c,d = luma[0] + HS signal of pixel 1

		Pixel 1:
		Subsamples a,b = luma[1] + HS signal of pixel 1
		Subsamples c,d = luma[1] + HS signal of pixel 2
		
		..etc
		
		
	
	For B&W mode -
		Just disable colorburst.
		
	For color mode -
		We need to sum the color signal and luma signal.
		
		i.e. generate a 16-value sine wave 
		Use chroma as an index into this
		
		Look up chroma, add luma
		
		Due to our limited R-ladder we only have 4 bits total
		which will limit luma to 3 bits.  By subsampling chroma
		signal and generating 4 bits of output we can hopefully
		make real color happen.
